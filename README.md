## 📖 Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Install it in your mods folder along with [ObsidianUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/obsidianui), (and [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) if wanted for better performances).

You will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via Forge's Mod List, you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!
You can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/ryoamiclights.toml`.

### Build

Just do `./gradlew build` and everything should build just fine!

# 📖 Compatibility

- [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) is recommended for better performances.
- **OptiFine/OptiForge/OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**
